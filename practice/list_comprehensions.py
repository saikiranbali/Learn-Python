# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

#creating list in normal way
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b=[]
for item in a:
    if(item%2==0):
        b.append(item)

print(b)

#creation of list in one single line
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b=[item for item in a if item%2==0]
print(b)


#To get the ages and create a new list by single for loop
years_of_birth = [1990, 1991, 1990, 1990, 1992, 1991]
ages = [2014 - year for year in years_of_birth]
print(ages)
